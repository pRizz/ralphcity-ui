## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Credential storage/keychain integration | Use system git credentials or prompt inline; complexity not justified for v1 |
| OAuth flows for GitHub/GitLab | PAT entry is simpler and sufficient |
| Clone from UI without URL (repo browser) | Paste URL is sufficient for v1 |
| Batch clone multiple repos | Single clone workflow first |
