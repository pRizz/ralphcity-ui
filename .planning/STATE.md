### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Affects |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-01-17 | CredentialState with tried_* flags | Prevent infinite credential callback loops in git2 | Backend auth |
| 2026-01-17 | SSH: agent first, then key file | Most common case is agent; fall back to key with passphrase | Backend auth |
| 2026-01-17 | GitHub PAT uses x-access-token username | GitHub's documented PAT authentication convention | Backend auth |
| 2026-01-17 | POST endpoint for credentials | Cleaner API: GET for no-creds, POST for credentials in body | API design |
| 2026-01-17 | auth_type hints in error response | Frontend can show appropriate UI based on auth type | API/Frontend |
| 2026-01-17 | errorInfo state for persistent error display | Keep error visible in dialog until retry/close | Frontend UI |
| 2026-01-17 | Use git2::ErrorClass for SSH/HTTPS classification | Semantic classification more reliable than string parsing | Error handling |
| 2026-01-17 | UserActionRequired returns 422 status | Same as UnprocessableEntity, user must take action | API responses |
| 2026-01-17 | Cancel EventSource when dialog closes during clone | Prevents orphaned connections | Frontend UI |
